# Install C library for raspberry pi(including zero)

# Rebuild the library for new versions!

This works with pre-compiled libs:
$ sudo cp libbcm2835.a /usr/local/lib/
$ sudo cp bcm2835.h /usr/local/include

If not, or if you'd rather build from new source:
- Download package archive from: http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/
$ tar zxvf bcm2835-version.tar.gz
$ cd bcm2835-version
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make check
$ sudo make install

The files from "This might work" should be installed
in those directories during this process.
